We've got four papers that explain the bizarre economics of fine-tuning \u2014 why your tiny 7B model outperforms a 72B beast after personality training, and why teaching AI to be helpful might actually lobotomize it.",

    "text": "Wait for the RLHF paper. But first, let's start with the forgetting problem. Luo and team at UC Berkeley published this in 2023, and it's the Rosetta Stone for understanding why fine-tuning goes sideways. Expert, what did they find?",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "So they took models ranging from 350 million parameters up to 13 billion, fine-tuned them on specific tasks, then tested what happened to their general capabilities. The core finding is brutal: catastrophic forgetting scales with model size. The bigger the model, the more it forgets when you fine-tune it.",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "skeptic",
    "text": "That's backwards from everything we assume about scale. Bigger models are supposed to be more robust.",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Right? But look at the numbers. When they fine-tuned a 350M parameter model on a single task, general performance dropped about 8 percent. Same protocol on a 13B model? Performance cratered by 23 percent. Almost three times worse.",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "Wait, so the model that cost ten times more to train is three times more fragile?",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Exactly. And they figured out why. Larger models have more specialized neurons. When you fine-tune, you're not just adjusting weights \u2014 you're overwriting highly specialized representations that took billions of tokens to learn. Small models have more general-purpose neurons, so fine-tuning doesn't destroy as much.",
    "paper_id": 9
  },
  {
    "speaker": "skeptic",
    "text": "This explains so much. I've seen startups fine-tune a 70B model on customer data and wonder why it suddenly can't do basic reasoning. They're literally erasing the intelligence they paid for.",

    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Imagine you have two employees. One is a generalist who does okay at everything. The other is a specialist with deep expertise. If you retrain both on a new task, the generalist adapts fine. But the specialist? You're overwriting years of specialized knowledge. That's what happens when you fine-tune a big model \u2014 you're destroying the specialization that made it smart.",

    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "They tested elastic weight consolidation, which identifies important neurons and protects them during training. It helped, but only reduced forgetting by about 30 percent. The fundamental tradeoff remains: big models are powerful but fragile.",

    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "And this connects directly to what Lin's team found at EMNLP 2024, because RLHF \u2014 the thing we use to make models helpful and safe \u2014 is just specialized fine-tuning. Expert, what's the alignment tax?",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "The alignment tax is what you pay when you use RLHF to align a model with human preferences. Lin and colleagues measured this precisely across multiple benchmarks. After RLHF, models lost 8 to 12 percent of their raw capability on tasks like math reasoning, code generation, and factual recall.",

    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "It gets worse. They found the tax is highest on capabilities that conflict with the reward model. So if you train a model to be polite and refuse certain requests, it becomes measurably worse at anything involving confident assertion or creative rule-breaking.",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "Holy shit. So when you train a model to say 'I can't help with that,' you're not just adding refusals \u2014 you're degrading its ability to think boldly?",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Yes. And here's the kicker: they tested personality fine-tuning specifically. When they tried to give an RLHF-aligned model a distinct personality, it resisted. The model had learned to default to safe, generic responses. Personality requires taking stances, expressing preferences, being specific \u2014 all things RLHF actively trains against.",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "skeptic",

    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Not totally opposed, but there's real tension. RLHF optimizes for consistency and safety. Personality requires variance and risk-taking. Lin's team measured this: base models adapted to personality prompts with 73 percent consistency. RLHF models? Only 51 percent.",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "That's the tradeoff. Lin's team tested a mitigation: elastic reward modeling, where you protect capability-critical neurons during RLHF. It reduced the alignment tax from 12 percent to 6 percent. Still a cost, but manageable.",
    "paper_id": 10

    "text": "Did they publish the implementation details?",
    "paper_id": 10
  },
  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Yes, and it's relatively straightforward. During RLHF, you run gradient attribution to identify which neurons activate most strongly for capability tasks \u2014 math, coding, reasoning. Then you apply a penalty to prevent large updates to those neurons. It's like saying 'you can adjust the model's tone, but don't touch the intelligence.'",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "skeptic",

  {
    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Right. Tang's approach was to fine-tune GPT-2 on the PersonaChat dataset \u2014 conversations where speakers have explicit personality traits like 'I love hiking' or 'I'm a vegetarian.' The model learned to condition responses on these traits.",

'I love hiking' isn't a personality, it's a fact. Real personality involves values, reasoning patterns, emotional tendencies \u2014 things PersonaGPT couldn't capture.",

    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Exactly. But what's interesting is their evaluation framework. They created the persona consistency metric: measuring whether the model's responses across multiple turns align with the stated personality. That metric is still used today, just with more sophisticated personalities.",

    "speaker": "expert",
    "text": "Great analogy. And they identified the core challenge that's still unsolved: the persona-knowledge tradeoff. If you fine-tune too hard on personality, the model forgets general knowledge. If you don't fine-tune enough, the personality is shallow. Sound familiar?",
    "paper_id": 11

    "speaker": "skeptic",

    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "And now we're at the point where this isn't just a technical challenge. Park's team published a survey in 2024 that asks: should we even be doing this? Expert, what's the deception angle?",

    "speaker": "expert",

  {
    "speaker": "expert",

  {
    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "But here's the tension: if you're trying to pass an individual Turing test \u2014 which is the whole point of personality cloning \u2014 you need it to be indistinguishable. Otherwise, what's the point?",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "skeptic",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "So let's synthesize. We've got four papers that tell one story: personality cloning is harder than it looks, and maybe that's good. The forgetting problem means big models are fragile.

    "speaker": "expert",

    "speaker": "host",
    "text": "Here's your one takeaway: if you're building personality AI, don't aim for indistinguishable. Aim for recognizably AI but genuinely useful. That's the sweet spot where the technology works, the ethics hold, and the market actually wants it. Thanks for listening to Paper Blitz.",
